# C++ Programming Journey

## Overview

This document highlights my learning and achievements in C++ programming. Over the course of my studies, I have completed more than 40 exercises covering a variety of foundational concepts and practical coding challenges. These exercises have provided me with a strong understanding of core C++ principles and enhanced my problem-solving skills.

## Core Concepts Learned

### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**
- **Classes and Objects**: I learned how to define classes and create objects. This included understanding the principles of encapsulation to keep data secure within classes.
- **Inheritance**: I explored single inheritance, gaining insights into how derived classes inherit properties and behaviors from base classes to promote code reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: I worked with basic polymorphism, focusing on compile-time polymorphism through function overloading and operator overloading.
- **Abstraction**: I practiced using abstract classes and interfaces to separate the concept of an object from its implementation, creating more flexible and manageable code.

### 2. **Memory Management**
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: I gained experience with `new` and `delete` operators for dynamic memory management and worked on avoiding memory leaks.
- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: I understood the importance of RAII for handling resource allocation and deallocation effectively to prevent resource leaks.

### 3. **Standard Library and Containers**
- **Containers**: I became proficient with fundamental containers such as `std::vector`, `std::list`, and `std::map`. I learned when and how to use each container effectively for different tasks.
- **Iterators**: I used iterators to traverse and manipulate containers, ensuring I could access elements efficiently.
- **Basic Algorithms**: I applied basic algorithms such as searching, sorting, and manipulating data within containers using simple loops and functions.

### 4. **Basic Exception Handling**
- **Try, Catch, and Throw**: I learned how to handle exceptions using `try`-`catch` blocks to make my code more robust and prevent runtime errors from crashing the program.

### 5. **Practical Exercises**

Throughout my learning process, I completed over 40 exercises that tested and expanded my understanding of various C++ concepts. Below are three examples of such exercises that showcase different aspects of my skill development:

#### Exercise 1: Bitcoin Value Lookup Program
I created a program that reads a CSV database containing bitcoin prices and outputs the value of a specific amount of bitcoin on a given date. The program parsed input data and handled date formatting, demonstrating my skills in working with strings, file I/O, and data parsing.

#### Exercise 2: `PmergeMe` Program
I implemented a sorting algorithm called `PmergeMe`, which used the Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort technique to sort a sequence of positive integers. The program was designed to handle at least 3000 integers, working with `std::vector` and `std::list` to ensure efficient sorting. This exercise reinforced my understanding of container manipulation, iterators, and implementing custom sorting algorithms.

#### Exercise 3: Polish Notation Calculator
I built a calculator program that evaluates expressions written in Polish notation. This task required me to parse and process expressions correctly, using a stack data structure to handle operations and evaluate expressions efficiently. This exercise deepened my understanding of stacks, expressions, and parsing logic.

*Note: These three exercises are just examples of the many challenges I completed to strengthen my C++ programming skills.*
